# P2 Reflection

## Things that went well
#### Sean Murphy
> Our ISP was made in a better format than last time showing that we met the needs of testing from every angle. Our tests were also made more efficient to create.
#### Alden Haase
> Our mutation scores were good off the bat which I think means we were doing a good job testing.
## Things that did not go well
#### Sean Murphy
> I personally created a pull request for something that was already done so I need to communicate better.
#### Lucas Dowers
> The Base Choice and ISP was a bit confusing throughout the sprint. I realized after working on the project for some time, it's easy to foget/ confuse some of the specs and get mixed up on how things should all work together.
#### Alden Haase
> I think some of our PRs could have been reviewed more closely, mine included.
## What would be done differently next time
#### Sean Murphy
> Communicate better when other responsibilities and classes build up.
#### Lucas Dowers
> Doing the ISP_md all in html like we did the first time would have been horrible. The html did look nice on the user end, but it was not fun to work with. Doing the tables in Markdown was also difficult. I think it would be helpful to find another way to make these charts for the next sprint.
#### Alden Haase
> Perhaps ask more question in general sooner rather than later.
