# P5 Reflection

## Things that went well
#### Alden Haase
> My teammates pulled together a real nice UI. I think the end result turned out to be user friendly and looks good too.
#### Kevin Finger
I focused mainly on React. I managed to improve my skills in handling components and handling state in functional components.
#### Lucas Dowers
Using React was enjoyable. Even though we were all pretty busy at the end of the semester with school / lives we managed to put together a pretty good and functional UI.

## Things that did not go well
#### Alden Haase
> I don't have much to say didn't go well.

#### Kevin Finger
I had some difficulties grasping certain React concepts at first, which slowed down my progress.

#### Lucas Dowers
I also had some struggles in the beginning remembering how to use React as it had been some time since i last used it. I think working off the base code tripped me up at first. Also not importing the boostrap.css that went along with React had me confused for over a week.

## What would be done differently next time
#### Alden Haase
> If this weren't the final sprint I think more planning could have helped. Work on the front-end, using React in particular, seems to require more
>synchronization than the back-end work we did.

#### Kevin Finger
In the future, I would spend more time on understanding the concepts and best practices of React before diving into the implementation. Additionally, I would communicate more with my teammates to ensure better synchronization and collaboration when working on the front-end.
