# P3 Reflection

## Things that went well
#### Lucas
All of the testing tools were succesfully added to the project which was good. We figured some bugs out in our code and in our tests. The PMD tool directly told us where potentially problematic code was. This report helped me to delete unused imports and clean up the code in our Company class which made it more readable.

## Things that did not go well
#### Lucas
The first part of the sprint was to fix faults/ failures/ failed tests so there was a lot of work put into that. Later we found out the report was faulty in the 'faults' section so our faults improved quite a bit. But we nnoticed we had a few more failures and failed tests. So maybe the report was faulty all over? I think there is still some confusion over the grading report, but nonetheless it helped us fix some issues or improve the code whether there was a problem or not. 
Some of the tools were a little bit troublesome to install but eventually figured it out.

## What would be done differently next time
##### Lucas
I think things went fine this sprint. Having Spring break in the middle is always a bit tricky navigating but it looks like we finished all the work and met all the requirements.
