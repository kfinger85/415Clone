## Things that went well
#### Lucas Dowers  
> We helped each other when needed. We also checked each other's work and asked questions about the code if something didn't look quite right. We all did the work we said we were going to do which is a good thing. We communicated better during the middle and end of P1.
#### Alden Haase
> Pull requests were reviewed and dealt with in a timely fashion, which is always appreciated when doing incremental developement. We also had an active conversation going in the team chat which was helpful.


## Things that did not go well
#### Lucas Dowers
> Nothing stuck out that did not go well. 
#### Alden Haase
> Nothing went badly. I think our team synchronization and planning could be better but I think this will improve with each sprint as we get to know each others work habbits and get more comfortable with the code base.


## What would be done differently next time
#### Lucas Dowers
> Things don't really need to be done differently, but I think we could improve some things to 
make what we did do better. Having more communication at the beginning of P2 could help. Make sure everyone is on the same page with what we are working on. It could also help to have a basic idea at the beginning of P2 of what everyone is going to start working on and then make adjustments as needed so we still make gradual progress.
#### Alden Haase
> I agree with Lucas about the potential benifits of increased communication at the beginning of p2. This could help with the previously mentioned planning and synchronization deficiencies. Now that we have a feel for the code base and the course, we could potentially layout more tasks in Zenhub before diving in.
