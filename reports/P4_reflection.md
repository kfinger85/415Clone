# P4 Reflection

## Things that went well

#### Chris

> This is the first time I've worked on setting up a rest controller and it was actually pretty easy to understand.
> We acomplished everything in the sprint pretty much 3 days early.

#### LD
  We had a new member this sprint and I think the transition was smooth and went really well.

 #### Kevin
> Effective communication and strong collaboration contributed to the identification and resolution of bugs and code issues, resulting in improved testing quality.
Prompt feedback on pull requests facilitated a fluid process.



## Things that did not go well

#### Chris

> I waited too long to get more work done beyond my initial pulls to where there was no work left to do

#### LD
I thought things went well with our team. 

#### Kevin
> Not much to report in this area. 

## What would be done differently next time

#### Chris

> I will be more proactive.  

#### LD
I'm not sure of the exact requirements for P5, but I think some of the work will be on the client side. I think it could be helpful to communicate as a team on design ideas(if that is something we will have to consider) at the beginning. 

#### Kevin 

> Sprint planning would be beneficial for IDing and creating tasks in the initial stage of the Sprint.
